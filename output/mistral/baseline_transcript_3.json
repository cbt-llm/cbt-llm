It's completely normal to feel anxious sometimes, but when it interferes with our daily life, it can be challenging. Let's work together to find strategies that help manage these feelings. One approach could be practicing relaxation techniques before the meeting, such as deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation. Another option is preparing for the meeting in advance by gathering necessary information and visualizing a successful outcome. If you feel comfortable, we can also explore other coping mechanisms that might work best for you."

One step could be setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day. This way, you can experience a sense of accomplishment and progress. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time.

Instead of focusing on the end result, let's focus on small steps that make you feel better each day. Remember, progress is not linear and it's okay if things don't go as planned.
