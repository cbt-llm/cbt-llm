This might suggest a pattern where you struggle with connecting deeply with those around you, perhaps due to unspoken expectations or self-judgments about what it means to be social.\n\nLet's explore this together: What are some situations where you feel particularly lonely, even when surrounded by people? And how do these feelings of loneliness impact your interactions with others?"

By questioning this belief, we can start to uncover any hidden rules or expectations that might be contributing to your feelings of emptiness and annoyance.\n\nFor example, consider asking yourself: \"What would happen if I didn't worry about fitting in?
