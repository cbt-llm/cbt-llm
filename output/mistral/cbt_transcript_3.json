This thought might be automatic for you, but let's consider an alternative interpretation: perhaps it's not that everyone is actually judging you, but rather your fear of being judged is so strong that it feels like they are.\n\nCould we explore together why you think people might be judging you?

This feeling might be causing you to question the validity of your thoughts, making you feel as though you're not good enough or that you're fooling everyone.\n\nHave you ever considered that this feeling could be an overactive inner critic? It's common for people to have an internal voice that is overly critical or harsh, but it's important to remember that this voice doesn't always reflect the truth about your abilities and worth.\n\nCan you think of a time when you felt confident in your ideas, even when"

By being open about your feelings, you might find that you connect with others on a deeper level, fostering stronger relationships.\n\nCan you think about a situation where you felt vulnerable but were pleasantly surprised by the response from those around you?"
