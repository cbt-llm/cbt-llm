Perhaps there are certain beliefs or expectations that contribute to this pattern? For example, do you feel like you need to constantly think or worry about something in order to stay safe or in control?\n\nBy identifying these thoughts and examining them more closely, we may find ways to help you relax your mind and improve the quality of your sleep.
